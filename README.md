## Architecture

### Extension Components
1. **Popup Interface** (`src/popup/`)
   - User interface for triggering analysis
   - Displays sustainability scores and statistics
   - Manages user preferences

2. **Content Script** (`public/content.js`)
   - Extracts product information from web pages
   - Injects sustainability badges
   - Handles user interactions

3. **Background Script** (`public/background.js`)
   - Manages ML model loading
   - Coordinates analysis requests
   - Handles cross-script communication

### Sustainability Analysis
1. **Product Detection**
   - Smart type detection based on keywords
   - Category-specific scoring adjustments
   - Contextual factor generation

2. **Scoring System**
   - Materials analysis (30%)
   - Energy efficiency (25%)
   - Packaging sustainability (15%)
   - Manufacturing impact (15%)
   - Product durability (15%)

3. **ML Pipeline**
   - Automated data collection
   - Feature extraction
   - Score prediction
   - Continuous improvement
